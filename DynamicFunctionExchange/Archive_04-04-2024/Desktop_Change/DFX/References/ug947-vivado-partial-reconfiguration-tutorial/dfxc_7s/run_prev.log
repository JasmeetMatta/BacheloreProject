which features and devices are licensed for your system.
Resolution: Check the status of your licenses in the Vivado License Manager. For debug help search Xilinx Support for "Licensing FAQ". If you are using a license server, verify that the license server is up and running a version of the xilinx daemon that is compatible with the version of Xilinx software that you are using. Note: Vivado 2021.1 and later versions require upgrading your license server tools to the Flex 11.17.2.0 versions. Please confirm with your license admin that the correct version of the license server tools are installed.
